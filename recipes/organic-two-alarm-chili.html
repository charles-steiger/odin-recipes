    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is my attempt to replicate the taste of the 
        <a href="https://reilyproducts.com/products/wick-fowlers-2-alarm-chili-kit-3-3-oz/" target="_blank">Wick Fowler's 2 Alarm Chili</a> kit
        using all organic ingredients.</p>
    <p>To recreate the ingredients from the recipe kit, I did my best to carefully measure each of the ingredients from the packages in the kit,
         with the following exceptions.</p>
    <p>This recipe:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Omits</em> "Corn Masa Flour"</li>
            <li><em>Omits</em> red peppers</li>
            <li><em>Substitutes</em> one cup of water by <em>not</em> draining the cooked ground beef fat</li>
            <li><em>Adds</em> fresh chopped vegetables</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Organic ingredients used if available</p>
    <!-- To do: Add pictures of ingredients -->
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs. of ground beef</li>
        <li>1-8 oz. can of tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup of water (*)</li>
        <li>1 tsp. salt (*)</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, white or yellow</li>
        <li>1 large bell pepper, your color of preference</li>
        <li>1 tbs. cumin</li>
        <li>1 tbs. oregano</li>
        <li>1 tbs. minced onion</li>
        <li>1 tbs. minced garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 cup ground dried chili pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <p>(*) Indicates a difference when compared to the Wick Fowler recipe</p>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Heat</strong> pot to medium low heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Chop</strong> the onion and bell pepper. Add chopped onion and bell pepper to pot. 
            If I skip using a food processor, I try to cut the pieces no larger than the keys on a keyboard.</li>
        <li><strong>Brown</strong> 2 lbs. ground beef. <em>Optional:</em> Drain fat. Increase water to 2 cups total.</li>
        <li><strong>Add</strong> all remaining ingredients and stir.</li>
        <li><strong>Cover</strong> and simmer 30 minutes or until meat is tender, stirring occassionally.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Thoughts About Chili</h2>
    <p>Most times it is impossible to save any chili for leftovers; however, if you can save some, leftover chili typically tastes better.</p>
    <p>I do not prefer beans, sour cream, or cheese with chili. If I add anything, I like to enjoy chili with plain or salted pork rinds.</p>
    <p>I typically choose grass fed and finished ground beef for this recipe. On occassion I will use one pound of ground beef mixed with one pound of 
        ground bison or one pound of <a href="https://forceofnature.com/products/regenerative-beef-ancestral-blend" target="_blank">Ancestral Blend</a>
         made by Force of Nature.</p>
    <p>Depending on the language of your country <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/usage-chili-chilli-chile" target="_blank">chili</a>
         can have various meanings and spellings.</p>
