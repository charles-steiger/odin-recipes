    <ul>
        <li>2 - 0.5 lb bone-in pork chops</li>
        <li>20-30 medium brussels sprouts</li>
        <li>2 tbs. ghee</li>
        <li>2 tsp. garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp. italian seasoning (oregano, thyme, sage)</li>
        <li>1 tsp. salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp. pepper</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Chop</strong> brussels sprouts. I highly recommend using a food processor for this step.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat</strong> pan to medium low heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Season</strong> pork chops by sprinkling garlic powder, italian seasoning, salt, and pepper on all sides of each chop.</li>
        <li><strong>Tenderize</strong> pork chops with a fork, pushing the seasoning into the pork chop.</li>
        <li><strong>Add</strong> 1 tbs. of ghee to pan followed by the pork chops once ghee is fully melted.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook</strong> pork chops, flipping every 2-5 minutes, until a minimum internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit is reached.</li>
        <li><strong>Remove</strong> pork chops from pan and add chopped brussels sprouts to pan with 1 tbs. of ghee.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook</strong> brussels sprouts 5-7 minutes, or until your desired tenderness. We like ours slighly crunchy.</li>
    </ol>
